Shahin – AI Security Decision Support Platform

## Overview
Shahin is an AI-powered security decision support platform that helps
security entities detect risks, predict incidents, and optimize patrol
deployment using data-driven insights.

## Problem

to gain a unified view, respond quickly, and act proactively.

## Solution
Shahin unifies security data into a single platform and transforms it into:
- Risk heatmaps
- Predictive insights
- Smart patrol allocation recommendations
